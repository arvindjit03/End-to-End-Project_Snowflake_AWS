# End-to-End-Project_Snowflake_AWS
A demo project to practically learn and understand the integration between Snowflake and AWS services. 

**AWS services used**: 

- Amazon S3
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**Amazon S3**: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers scalable storage for data backup, archival, and analytics. It allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

**IAM**: IAM is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, and roles, and assign permissions to them to control access to AWS resources.
